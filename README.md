# Quick watch 🎬
## Hello there! (＾Ｕ＾)ノ~ＹＯ
This is my second time using a API to render data. Feeling more comfortable with it.😁
- I'm using https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction and https://axios-http.com/.
- It's a SPA where you can search movies, series or directors (this last one is actually under development).
