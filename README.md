## Hello there! (＾Ｕ＾)ノ~ＹＯ
This is my second time using a API to render data into the DOM. Feeling more comfortable with it.😁
- I'm using https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction and https://axios-http.com/.
- It's gonna be a SPA where you can search from movies to series or directors. ![MoviesGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69522907/168444264-91467aa6-58a5-47da-8996-d41dff8ef28a.gif)
- Guess i'm trying to add lazy-loading to the images and modals. Some animations would be cool too. 🤔
